# Hello world!

This is a project page.

{footnote: This is a footnote, it should be given a number, and is suitable for references or definitions}
{sidenote: This should be a sidenote! These (and footnotes) should probably use the aside element}

{sidenote}
Sidenote blocks?
{/sidenote}

```
print("Hello world")
```
